# Advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP): Exploring Large Language Models (LLMs) and Their Applications
**Author**: Dr. Elena Nazarenko

## Description
In this class we cover:

- Prompt Engineering
- Transformers
- Transformer-Based Contextual Sentence Classification
- Moving Towards Fine-Tuning of LLMs

## Infrastructure
We will use google colab to train transformer's model

## Introduction to fine-tuning of LLMs
We will use library lamini to explore non fine-tune vs fine-tune models, as well as first steps towards to instuction fine-tuning
