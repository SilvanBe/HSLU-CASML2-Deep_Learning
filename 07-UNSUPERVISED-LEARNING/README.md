# Unsupervised Learning - Hands On
**Author**: Dr. Yves Staudt

## Description Class
In this classes we treat unsupervised learning, namely

- clustering
- dimension reduction.

In clustering we treat 
- k-means clustering
- hierarchical clustering

In dimension reduction we treat 
- principal component analysis (PCA)
- t-distributed stochastic neighboring.

## Data Set Information
For this purpose a lego dataset is used, built through scraping. 

All the data preparations were done in advance. 


## Requirements Coding
The codes are given in python. I use a conda version. The needed requirements are given in the requirement.txt file. 
Best is to create a new conda version with the txt file with the following command
